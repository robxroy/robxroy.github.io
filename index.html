<hr>

    <p> <img id="fluke" src="assets/images/fluke.jpg" alt="Rob X. Roy" style="float: left">Rob X. Roy is a Full Stack Web Development student at the University of Pennsylvania College of Liberal and Professional Studies. Rob was born and raised in Northern California's central valley. 
        Rob beams with civic pride for his hometown and can tell you a lot of history of the region, discuss neighborhood level diversity indexes (to which Sacramento is a national leader in), or go into detail about the geography mentioned in the movie Lady Bird.
       While achieving a degree in English from the University of California -- Davis, Rob was a radio DJ, an ice cream man, and a politician. 
</p><p>    After graduating university, Rob taught English abroad for several years. While in South Korea, Rob met a lady from Philadelphia.  They traveled the world together and when returning to live in the states Rob moved to Philadelphia. All in all, Rob has been to more than twenty countries and four continents. Rob's hobbies include storytelling, songwriting, and evangelizing on how the best electoral methodology is Ranked Choice Voting.
</p><p>
Rob wants to use a knowledge of coding to build a career in the field as well as help provide greater access to civic participation and pass along this knowledge to communities who do not have as easy access to the foundations of web development.
